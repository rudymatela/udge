hello - Hello, World!
---------------------

Write a program that prints "Hello, World!" on the standard output device.
Normally, the output device is the screen of a command line session:

	$ ./hello
	Hello, World!

Hint: On some systems (Windows / Linux / OS X), it is possible to redirect the
output of your program to a file, like so:

	$ ./hello > outputfile.txt

### Scoring

* 1/6: compiles
* 2/6: prints something
* 3/6: prints hello world somehow
* 4/6: prints "Hello, world!" exactly
* 5/6: terminates
* 6/6: exits successfully
