add - Addition
--------------

Write a program that
	reads several pairs of numbers and,
	for each pair, prints the sum.
The standard input and output devices
	are usually the keyboard and screen of a command line session.
Here is an example session with this program:

	$ ./add
	0 0
	0
	3 7
	10
	12 21
	33
	123 321
	444
	1234 4321
	5555

### Example input

	0 0
	3 7
	12 21
	123 321
	1234 4321


### Example output

	0
	10
	33
	444
	5555

### The `add` function

For a full score,
in addition to producing the correct output,
the program should be implemented using an `add` function
that receives two integers as arguments and returns an integer.
Please refer to the information for the chosen language:

* C prototype:        `int add(int x, int y);`
* Haskell type:       `add :: Int -> Int -> Int`
* Python definition:  `def add(x,y):`

If you're confused, try earning a partial score first.

### Scoring

* 4/6: adds numbers
* 5/6: handles edge cases
* 6/6: implements the `add` function
