hello-world -- Hello, World!
----------------------------

Write a program that prints "Hello, World!" on the standard output device.
Normally, the output device is the screen of a command line session:

	$ ./hello-world
	Hello, World!

Hint: On some systems (Windows / Linux / OS X), it is possible to redirect the
output of your program to a file, like so:

	$ ./hello-world > outputfile.txt

This is one of the default examples of Udge.  This differs from [hello](/hello)
in that this version provides a simple 0/1 or 1/1 scoring.
