TODO list for Udge
==================

* submissions are overwritten if they are created withing the same second for the same user, rate limit to fix this

* allow parsing of problem name and language from file name (instead of fields)

* make so that I don't need to use `index.html` with nginx.  `/path/to/page`
  should display the HTML given in `/path/to/page.html`

Future
======

* installation script

* development setup script

* sandbox before running submissions

* fix weird edge cases on tests

* remove partial form filling on errors (for simplicity)

* support command line arguments (`args` file aditionally to `in` and `out`)

* support `err` as well (specific error output)
