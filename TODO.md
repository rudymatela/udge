	- for each problem, add extra column showing the best scores for the last
	  submitted languages

	- problems appearing on a specific order

	- problems separated by chapter/volume

	- only show problems with tries


For later
---------

* `touch` problem that requires files to appear

* Let users configure if they would be appear anonymized on the ranking and
  have a private user page.  (All this as a single option.)

* Add a user's submission page?  `u/<user_name>/submissions`

* Languages to support later (in no particular order):

	- Lua
