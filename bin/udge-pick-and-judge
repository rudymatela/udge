# pick-and-judge:
# 1. goes into the submissions folder
# 2. picks something to be judged
# 3. judges
# 4. stores results in the desired format
#
# Pick and judge needs to be run with write permissions to the submissions
# folder, to do this, you may want to add your user (or the user for which the
# judge will run) to the http group.
#
# This script only works when Udge is set up with a single user.
# It is intended to be used in development environments and not on actual
# production deployments.  Please use etc/cron.d/udge instead.
